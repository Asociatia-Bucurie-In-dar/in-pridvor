### 🔍 **Detection Methods**

## 🚀 Implementation Options

### Option 1: Admin Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin
2. Navigate to Users collection
3. Create users with the data from the script output
4. Note down user IDs and update posts manually

### Option 2: SQL Direct Insert
Use the generated SQL commands from the script to create users directly in the database.

### Option 3: API Automation (When authentication is resolved)
Use the Payload SDK scripts once authentication issues are resolved.

- **Email**: `[name]@email.com` (temporary emails)
